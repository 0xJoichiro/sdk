/// An identity is a construct that denotes the set of claims of an
/// entity about itself.

/// Identification is the procedure whereby an entity claims a certain
/// identity, while verification is the procedure whereby that claim
/// is checked. Authentication is the assertion of an entityâ€™s claim
/// to an identity.

/// A role represents the set of actions an entity equipped with that
/// role can exercise.

/// A principal describes the security context of an identity, namely
/// any identity that can be authenticated along with a specific
/// role. In the case of the Internet Computer this maps currently to
/// the identities that can be authenticated by a canister.

/// A controller is a principal with an administrative-control role
/// over a corresponding canister. Each canister has one or more
/// controllers. A controller can be a person, an organization, or
/// another canister

/// An identifier is a sequence of bytes/string utilized as a name for
/// a principal. That allows a principal to be referenced.

/// An identity describes a user or any entity in general that can be
/// authenticated. An identity may have access to multiple principals
/// or credential services, each combination represented by a provider.
